Jonathan (Jonny) Johannes' Dotfiles
===================================
  These are the ever-evolving configurations I use to make the terminal feel like home. 

  The systems I use are my Mac and a number of Linux systems including the [WestGrid](http://westgrid.ca/) computers.

Installation
------------
    
    git clone git://github.com/jonnyjohannes/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    source install.sh
